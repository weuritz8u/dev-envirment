# Other VSCode

If you have installed VSCode in another directory and
want to use this installation, change the name of this
file from `other_vs_code.md` to `other_vs_code` and
open the `run_server_for_testing.bat` file and check
line 10.

```
start "" "C:\D4R4\.can_delete\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" "%cd%"
```

`C:\D4R4\.can_delete\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe` is the
used folder path, replace it with your folder path.

finished!
